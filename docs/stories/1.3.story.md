## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[Source: Story 1.1, 1.2]
- Orange Pi HTTP server runs on port 8080 with HTTPS/TLS
- Self-signed certificates generated on device startup
- Device creates WiFi hotspot with SSID pattern "RNG-Miner-XXXXXXXX"
- Hotspot IP address: 192.168.12.1 (needs confirmation - might be 192.168.4.1)
- Mobile app must trust and save device certificates for future communication

### Tech Stack and Implementation Guidelines
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Framework:** React Native (latest stable version)
- **Language:** TypeScript for type safety and better development experience
- **Navigation:** React Navigation v6 for cross-platform navigation
- **HTTP Client:** axios or custom fetch wrapper with HTTPS certificate handling
- **WiFi Library:** react-native-wifi-reborn or platform-specific APIs
- **UI Library:** React Native Elements, NativeBase, or custom components

</dict>
```

### HTTP Client Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, coding-standards.md]
```typescript
// Device API Service Configuration
interface DeviceApiConfig {
    baseUrl: string;
    timeout: number;
    certificateFingerprint?: string;
    retryAttempts: number;
}

class DeviceApiService {
    private config: DeviceApiConfig;
    private trustedCertificates: Map<string, string> = new Map();

    constructor(config: DeviceApiConfig) {
        this.config = config;
    }

    async trustCertificate(deviceIp: string, certificate: string): Promise<void> {
        // Save certificate for this specific device
        this.trustedCertificates.set(deviceIp, certificate);
        // Persist to secure storage
    }

    async makeRequest(endpoint: string, options: RequestInit = {}): Promise<any> {
        // Include certificate validation logic
        // Handle self-signed certificate trust
    }
}
```

### WiFi Scanning Implementation
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
```typescript
interface WiFiNetwork {
    SSID: string;
    BSSID: string;
    level: number; // Signal strength
    frequency: number;
    capabilities: string;
    timestamp: number;
}

interface DeviceInfo {
    deviceId: string;
    ssid: string;
    signalStrength: number;
    ipAddress: string;
}

class WiFiScanner {
    async scanForNetworks(): Promise<WiFiNetwork[]> {
        // Platform-specific WiFi scanning implementation
    }

    async findOrangePiDevices(): Promise<DeviceInfo[]> {
        const networks = await this.scanForNetworks();
        return networks
            .filter(network => network.SSID.startsWith('RNG-Miner-'))
            .map(network => ({
                deviceId: network.SSID.replace('RNG-Miner-', ''),
                ssid: network.SSID,
                signalStrength: network.level,
                ipAddress: '192.168.12.1' // Default hotspot IP
            }));
    }
}
```

### Navigation Structure
```typescript
// Navigation types
type RootStackParamList = {
    DeviceDiscovery: undefined;
    DeviceSetup: { deviceId: string };
    SetupProgress: { deviceId: string };
    DeviceManagement: { deviceId: string };
};

// Navigation configuration
const AppNavigator = () => (
    <NavigationContainer>
        <Stack.Navigator initialRouteName="DeviceDiscovery">
            <Stack.Screen name="DeviceDiscovery" component={DeviceDiscoveryScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="DeviceSetup" component={DeviceSetupScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="SetupProgress" component={SetupProgressScreen} />
            <Stack.Screen name="DeviceManagement" component={DeviceManagementScreen} />
        </Stack.Navigator>
    </NavigationContainer>
);
```

### Error Handling and Validation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
- Implement comprehensive error boundaries for React components
- Add input validation for all user inputs (WiFi credentials, seed phrases)
- Handle network errors gracefully with retry mechanisms
- Provide clear user feedback for all error conditions
- Log errors for debugging while avoiding sensitive data exposure

### Security Considerations
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, seed phrases)
- Implement secure storage for trusted certificates
- Validate all user inputs before transmission
- Handle certificate trust decisions with user confirmation
- Prepare for future security enhancements (dynamic tokens, encryption)

### Development and Build Configuration
- Configure Metro bundler for optimal performance
- Set up development environment for both platforms
- Configure debugging tools and error reporting
- Set up continuous integration for automated testing
- Document platform-specific build requirements
