# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
Ultra-simplified onboarding flow that gets users from "unopened box" to "mining device working" in under 10 minutes. The app prioritizes clear instructions and real-time feedback over advanced features. Success is measured by user completion rate, not feature richness.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Wizard-style setup flow** - Linear progression through required steps
- **Real-time status updates** - User sees exactly what's happening on the device
- **Minimal input required** - Only essential information (WiFi, 12 words, basic configs)
- **Visual confirmation** - Clear success/failure indicators at each step

## Core Screens and Views
- **Device Discovery Screen** - Scan and select Orange Pi device
- **WiFi Configuration Screen** - Enter home network credentials
- **Seed Phrase Entry Screen** - Input 12-word mnemonic
- **Mining Configuration Screen** - Basic mining parameters
- **Setup Progress Screen** - Real-time status of device configuration
- **Success Confirmation Screen** - Setup complete with next steps
- **Device Management Dashboard** - Ongoing device monitoring and updates

## Accessibility: None
V1 focuses on working functionality over accessibility compliance

## Branding
Functional and clean interface. No specific branding requirements for V1 - focus on clarity and usability.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform
Mobile app must work on both iOS and Android devices with WiFi capability
